Chess Game with Socket.io
This is a real-time multiplayer chess game built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Chess.js. It allows two players to play chess (one as white and one as black), while others can join as spectators. The game automatically handles moves, detects checkmate and draw conditions, and provides an option to start a new game.

Features

Spectator mode: If more than two users join, they become spectators.
Real-time moves: Updates the board state in real-time for all connected players.
Checkmate and draw detection: Displays alerts when the game ends.
New Game Button: Allows restarting the game.
